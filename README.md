# Null-Porn
Null-Porn is a project born out of frustration with the increasing presence of pornographic and explicit content on platforms such as [YouTube](https://youtube.com)/[YouTube Shorts](https://shorts.youtube.com) and [TikTok](https://tiktok.com). These platforms have been inundated with spam bots that not only disrupt the user experience but also display offensive and inappropriate material. In response to this issue, I have taken the initiative to a `DDoS` attack which is usually capable to take them down as their security is usually weak. 

## Compatibility

This project is primarily optimized for Unix-based systems. It leverages the `curl`  library, which is commonly available on Unix systems. While it may also work on other operating systems, it is recommended to use a Unix system for the best compatibility and performance.
